This project is a framework to detect and recognize object in video or image. This project help me to practice the basic machine learning algorithm and do research on course project.

Operation System: 
Unbuntu and MacOS

Language: 
C++

Library: 
armadillo (for matrix operation such as SVD)
Opencv (for video and image processing)
CodeLib (a library written by myself to debug)

Now we have 
3 kind of Classifier: Neural Network, SVM and Adaboost.
1 kind of feature: eigen-X generator and feature generator
Some training toolkit.

Use "DataCollector" to label and collect data from video.
Use "MLApplication" to develope new application based on this framework.
